# Hoist Dockerfile: xh-tomcat

Hoist React apps can be deployed via Docker containers running Tomcat (for Hoist's Grails based
back-end) and nginx (to serve compiled client JS/CSS and other assets).

This repo contains a minimal Dockerfile to build the base Tomcat container, which can be used
by app-specific Docker deployments with additional configurations.

This image is [available on Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/xhio/xh-tomcat/).
